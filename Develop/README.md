## Description:

This is a project based readme generator. For my homework, we were tasked to build this using node.js, and the end product is to have an app generate a professional looking readme file for your projects.

<a name="steps"></a>

## Steps:

For this to work, you must clone the repo first. Then, npm init the index.js. After that, you need to npm i to get the inquirer downloaded. Finally, going into the develop directory in terminal, type node index.js, this will start the prompts to gather info to put on a readme document.
